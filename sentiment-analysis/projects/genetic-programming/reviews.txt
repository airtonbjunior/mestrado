[t]excellent picture quality / color 
canon powershot g3[+3]##i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase . 
use[+2]##the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group . 
##after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us . 
##i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way . 
picture[+2]##they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) . 
picture quality[+1]##a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality . 
picture quality[+1]##i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) . 
##ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras . 
camera[+2], use[+2], feature[+1]##bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . 
picture quality[+3], use[+1], option[+1]##i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like . 
##great job canon ! 
[t]cool toy
##yep . 
camera[+2]##this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is ! 
##i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it . 
picture[+2]##just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance . 
use[+1]##whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together . 
##+ you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc. 
##as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) . 
##i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast . 
##a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images . 
##some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ). 
dial[-1]##* main dial is not backlit . 
viewfinder[-2]##* lens visible in optical viewfinder . 
##( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too . 
camera[+2][p]##overall i 'm happy with my toy . 
[t]canon g3 ? incredible camera 
##i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras . 
##a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models . 
##following my research , i decided on the g3 . 
camera[+3]##in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera . 
speed[+2],picture quality[+2],function[+2]##i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers . 
auto setting[+2]##with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet . 
##and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image . 
camera[+3]##i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 . 
##do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed . 
[t]great camera 
canon g3[+3]##i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied . 
photo quality[+2]##i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality . 
feature[+2]##the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds . 
##flaws ? 
viewfinder[-1]##the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me . 
##still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera . 
camera[+2]##despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography . 
[t]have n't had practice but i 'm already in love with it 
camera[+2]##i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful . 
photo quality[+3]##the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features . 
##i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) . 
##i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera . 
darn diopter adjustment dial[-1]##the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . ) 
##i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review . 
[t]excellent for the semi-serious amateur 
##positives 
exposure control[+2],auto setting[+2]##1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings . 
metering option[+2]##excellent range of metering options as well . 
spot metering[+1]##it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen . 
4mp[+1]##2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer ) 
zoom[+1]##3 ) 4x zoom is nice 
##4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed . 
focus[+2]##5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible . 
focus[+2]##you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus . 
##negatives 
size[-2][u],weight[-2][u]##1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line ) 
design[-2][u]##2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens ) 
viewfinder[-2]##4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying . 
[t]fantastic digital camera 
feature[+2], ##the camera has a wonderful set of features . 
lcd[+2]##the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures . 
##you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd . 
optical zoom[+2],digital zoom[+1]##the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry . 
picture[+3]##the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect . 
picture[+3]##i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased . 
software[+2]##the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use . 
lens cap[-1],viewfinder[-1]##the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) . 
menu[+1],button[+1]##the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use . 
camera[+3]##it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price . 
[t]the best of everything 
camera[+3]##recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available . 
control[+2]##advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable . 
auto setting[+2]##newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box . 
photo quality[+3]##4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome . 
##do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype . 
##unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it . 
use[+2][u]##those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use . 
##anyone looking for more than " point and shoot " can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference . 
zoom[+2],lense[+2]##the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class . 
##i expect the g3 will please me for years to come . 
[t]pure class & quality - a work of craftmanship 
camera[+3]##i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period ! 
picture[+3], control[+2], battery[+2], software[+2]##it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing . 
photo quality[+2], auto mode[+2]##i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode . 
##absolutely breathtaking .
